            <p>A primary care physician is someone who:<br>

                1.treats minor illnesses<br>
                2.answers health questions<br>
                3.conducts health checkups<br>
                4.performs routine health tests, including those for cholesterol or blood sugar levels<br>
                5.provides referrals to specialty physicians when necessary<br>
                6.keeps a person’s medical records together<br><br>
                A primary care doctor may be one of the following types:<br><br>

            <h3>Family practice physician</h3><br>
            Family practice physicians are also called family medicine doctors. They treat people of all ages.<br>

            <h3>Internal medicine physician</h3><br>
            An internal medicine physician performs many of the same tasks as a family practice physician. However,
            internal medicine physicians treat adults only.<br>

            <h3>Family medicine vs. internal medicine physicians</h3>
            Although family medicine and internal medicine physicians can both treat adults, the American College of
            Physicians say that there are some key differences.

            For example, internal medicine doctors have training in both general medicine and subspecialties. They also
            tend to be more focused on medical issues that affect adults.

            Family physicians, meanwhile, have broader training in medicine that allows them to care for both children
            and adults. They can treat a wide range of medical issues and emphasize disease prevention and health
            maintenance.<br>

            <h3>Pediatricians</h3>
            Pediatricians focus on treating children from birth to young adulthood. They may be a child’s primary care
            physician and have training in:<br>

            1.well-baby and well-child visits<br>
            2.school or sports physicals<br>
            3.childhood vaccines<br>
            4.disease prevention for children and babies<br>
            5.treating illnesses and injuries in children and babies<br>
            <h3>Geriatric medicine doctors</h3><br>
            Geriatric medicine doctors, also called geriatricians, focus on care for older adults.<br>

            According to the American Medical AssociationTrusted Source, geriatricians are internal medicine or family
            medicine doctors who have additional training in:<br>

            1.the aging process<br>
            2.preventive care for older adults<br>
            3.the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect older adults<br>

                    able to.</i></h1><br>

                years of study in the field of allergy and immunology after earning a medical degree.

                <h2>Summary</h2><br>
                <p>Each type of doctor undergoes their own unique training and education to allow them to diagnose and
                    treat specific diseases and conditions.<br><br>

                    Because there are so many types of doctors, most people see a primary care physician for health
                    problems first. This doctor may then refer or recommend the person to see a specialist when they
                    need one.</p><br><br>
